## To-Do List Reprise

My first dive into React! Along the way, I made use of React's documentation to recreate a simplified version of a previous project. Issues with state came up while trying to pass data between the form component and it's value that was previously kept in the wrapper component. Moving relavent state down to the form component simplied the issue. Functions had difficulty begin passed down as props in this project until the this keyword was bound to the component it was in.
